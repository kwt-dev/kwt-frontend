## Problem-Agitation-Solution Framework

### Problem Subsection
**Header (24px bold):** "The Heat & Damage Reality"
**Content (16px, line-height 1.6):**
"Your vehicle's interior reaches **140°F+** on summer days. Every minute of UV exposure accelerates leather cracking, dashboard fading, and creates a dangerously uncomfortable driving environment that forces your AC to work overtime."

### Agitation Subsection  
**Header:** "The Cost of Waiting"
**Subheader:** "Without proper protection:"
**Bullet List (styled with warning icons):**
- Interior replacement costs: $3,000-$8,000+
- Increased fuel consumption from overworked AC
- Skin damage from UV exposure (SPF 4 vs. our SPF 1000+)
- Resale value loss from faded, cracked interiors
- Daily discomfort and safety risks from heat/glare

### Solution Subsection
