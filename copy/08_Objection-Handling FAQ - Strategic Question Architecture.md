### FAQ Item 1: Pricing Objection
**Question (20px, bold, dark gray):** "How much does professional window tinting cost?"
**Answer Content (16px, line-height 1.6):**
"Premium protection is more affordable than most people expect. Our ceramic tint packages start at $299 for sedans and $399 for SUVs. While budget shops offer cheaper alternatives, our premium installation with lifetime warranty typically costs less than replacing faded interior components or dealing with bubbled, peeling tint from inferior installation.

**Consider this:** Interior replacement costs $3,000-$8,000+. Our protection costs less than one interior repair and lasts the lifetime of your vehicle."

### FAQ Item 2: Quality Differentiation  
**Question:** "What makes King's different from cheaper options?"
**Answer:**
"We refuse to cut corners where others do. While budget shops use hand-cutting and cheap films that fail within years, we invest in computer-cutting technology and premium ceramic materials. Our 25+ years of experience shows in every detail — perfect edges, seamless application, and zero-bubble installation that looks factory-perfect.

**The real question:** What's more expensive — doing it right once, or doing it wrong twice?"

### FAQ Item 3: Time Investment
**Question:** "How long does the installation process take?"
**Answer:**
"Most automotive installations are completed in 2-3 hours. We never rush quality for speed — each vehicle receives the time needed for perfect results. You can relax in our comfortable waiting area with free Wi-Fi, or drop off your vehicle and return when convenient."

### FAQ Item 4: Warranty Concerns
**Question:** "What if I notice an issue after installation?"
**Answer:**
"Your satisfaction is unconditionally guaranteed. Any concerns within 30 days are addressed immediately at no charge. Our lifetime warranty covers materials and workmanship — if our tint bubbles, peels, or fades, we replace it free. We can offer this confidence because our installation quality and material selection eliminate these problems."

### FAQ Item 5: Scheduling Urgency
**Question:** "How far in advance should I book?"
**Answer:**
"While we sometimes accommodate same-week requests, we recommend booking 1-2 weeks in advance, especially during peak summer months. Premium appointment slots fill quickly because vehicle owners who demand the best plan ahead."

### FAQ Item 6: Material Quality
**Question:** "Do you use the same materials as other shops?"
**Answer:**
"Absolutely not. We exclusively use premium ceramic films from industry leaders like XPEL and 3M. These materials cost significantly more than the cheap dyed films many shops use, but they deliver superior heat rejection, UV protection, and longevity. The difference is immediately noticeable and guaranteed to last."

### FAQ Item 7: Warranty Coverage
**Question:** "What exactly does your lifetime warranty cover?"
**Answer:**
"Our lifetime warranty covers all materials and workmanship. This includes bubbling, peeling, fading, and any installation defects. We also warranty against discoloration and adhesive failure. Unlike limited warranties from other shops, ours covers the full cost of removal and reinstallation if any covered issue occurs."
